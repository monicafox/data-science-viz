Infographic Key:                                                                                                  

Rings = Roles in DS Field 

Wedges = Top Industries for DS Work

Colored blocks = Type of work typically performed by a role within an industry

Graphic Summary:
Venturing away from the traditional, statistic-driven infographic, the goal of this chart is to elicit conversation within the data science field and community by illustrating the breadth and depth of complex relationships and patterns that emerged from our research.  
Data Set: 
See the underlying data set and resources used in building the data visualization

Specifically, this chart shows relationships between:
-	the 6 major roles within the field (listed in strategic order within top center wedge)
-	the 8 essential types of work they do (identified in center, distinguished by color, and ordered by the most common, chronological sequence in which they occur, moving from left to right)
-	8 top industries where data science is being utilized the most, and thus are (or could be) employing the most skills in the varying capacities identified with the 8 colors; those 8 industries are broken down as such:
-	5 industries IBM is currently serving well
-	2 industries (Scientific: Life & Chemical, IT and Tech) we felt IBM has the opportunity to expand with data science, following a competitive analysis of IBM’s immediate competitors 
-	1 industry (Fraud & Cybersecurity) that is currently getting a lot of buzz and one we predict will evolve to become its own vertical; we feel IBM could lead that data science conversation and evolution
Important things to keep in mind:
-	This graphic is intended to show “lines of best fit,” for relationships within the “moving target,” field of data science; the rules and standards are still being written and changing by the day
-	The door is still open for lots of additional research about specifics, with this graphic being the starting point, and presenting the opportunity of potentially making this chart interactive and more engaging
